## 🏗️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Make
- Git
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for testing
- Jira account for integration testing (optional)

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Wangggym/quick-workflow.git
cd quick-workflow/go-version

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Run linters
make lint
```

## 📝 Code Style

### Go Code

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use `gofmt` to format code (run `make fmt`)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write meaningful variable names
- Add comments for exported functions and types

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for GitLab integration
fix: handle empty Jira ticket gracefully
docs: update installation instructions
test: add tests for GitHub client
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/github/...
go test ./internal/jira/...

# Run with coverage
make coverage

# Run with race detector
go test -race ./...
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `*_test.go` files
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Mock external dependencies (GitHub API, Jira API)
- Test both success and error cases

Example:
```go
func TestSanitizeBranchName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
    }{
        {"simple", "hello world", "hello-world"},
        {"special chars", "hello@world!", "hello-world"},
        {"multiple dashes", "hello--world", "hello-world"},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := SanitizeBranchName(tt.input)
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("got %s, want %s", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## 📚 Documentation
