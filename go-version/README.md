## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Download Binary (Recommended)

#### macOS Installation

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon - M1/M2/M3)
curl -L https://github.com/Wangggym/quick-workflow/releases/latest/download/qkflow-darwin-arm64 -o qkflow

# macOS (Intel)
curl -L https://github.com/Wangggym/quick-workflow/releases/latest/download/qkflow-darwin-amd64 -o qkflow

# 🔑 Important: Remove macOS quarantine attribute to bypass Gatekeeper (if needed)
# Note: If you get "No such xattr: com.apple.quarantine", that's fine - skip this step
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine qkflow 2>/dev/null || echo "No quarantine attribute found (this is fine)"

# Make executable and install
chmod +x qkflow
sudo mv qkflow /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
qkflow version
```

> **⚠️ macOS Security Notice**: If you see "qkflow-darwin-arm64 cannot be opened because Apple cannot verify that it is free of malware", this is normal for unsigned binaries. The `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` command above will resolve this issue safely.

#### Linux Installation

```bash
# Linux (x86_64)
curl -L https://github.com/Wangggym/quick-workflow/releases/latest/download/qkflow-linux-amd64 -o qkflow
chmod +x qkflow
sudo mv qkflow /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
qkflow version
```

### Option 2: Install with Go

```bash
go install github.com/Wangggym/quick-workflow/cmd/qkflow@latest
```

### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wangggym/quick-workflow.git
cd quick-workflow/go-version
make build
sudo cp bin/qkflow /usr/local/bin/
```

## ⚙️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Git installed and configured
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated: `gh auth login`
- Jira API token: [Get one here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

### Initial Configuration

Run the interactive setup:

```bash
qkflow init
```

This will prompt you for:
- Email address
- GitHub token (auto-detected from `gh` CLI)
- Jira service address (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net)
- Jira API token
- Optional: Branch prefix
- Optional: OpenAI API key for AI features

**Configuration Storage:**

✨ **NEW**: On macOS, all configs are automatically saved to iCloud Drive in a single directory and synced across all your devices!

- **macOS with iCloud Drive**: Synced across devices ☁️
  - 📂 All configs in: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/.qkflow/`
- **Local Storage** (fallback): 
  - 📂 All configs in: `~/.qkflow/`

Both locations contain:
- `config.yaml` - Main configuration
- `jira-status.json` - Jira status mappings

Run `qkflow config` to see your actual storage location.

📖 See [iCloud Migration Guide](ICLOUD_MIGRATION.md) for more details.

```

## 📝 Configuration Files

### Storage Location

qkflow intelligently stores configurations based on your system:

**macOS with iCloud Drive** (Recommended):
- Configs are stored in iCloud Drive and automatically synced across your Mac devices
- All configs in: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/.qkflow/`
  - `config.yaml` - Main configuration
  - `jira-status.json` - Jira status mappings

**Local Storage** (Fallback):
- All configs in: `~/.qkflow/`
  - `config.yaml` - Main configuration
  - `jira-status.json` - Jira status mappings

Run `qkflow config` to see your actual storage location.

### Configuration Format

```yaml
email: your.email@example.com
jira_api_token: your_jira_token
jira_service_address: https://your-domain.atlassian.net
github_token: ghp_your_github_token
branch_prefix: feature  # optional
openai_key: sk-your_openai_key  # optional
```

## 🔒 Security

- Tokens are stored securely in your config directory (local or iCloud)
- File permissions are set to `0600` (user read/write only)
- iCloud storage is encrypted and secure
- Never commit the config file or share it
- Use environment variables for CI/CD:
  ```bash
  export QK_GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx
  export QK_JIRA_API_TOKEN=xxx
  ```

**Note**: If using iCloud Drive, your configurations will sync across your Mac devices automatically, providing a seamless experience.

## 🚧 Migration from Shell Version

See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for detailed migration guide.

**Quick comparison:**

| Feature | Shell Version | Go Version |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Installation | Clone + dependencies | Single binary |
| Configuration | `.zshrc` / `.bashrc` | `qk init` |
| Dependencies | `gh`, `jira`, `jq`, etc. | None (self-contained) |
| Speed | ~1-2s startup | <100ms startup |
| Platform | macOS/Linux | macOS/Linux/Windows |
| Updates | `git pull` | Download new binary |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### macOS Installation Issues

#### "qkflow-darwin-arm64 cannot be opened" Error

If you encounter this error:
```
"qkflow-darwin-arm64" cannot be opened because Apple cannot verify that it is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.
```

**Solution 1: Remove Quarantine Attribute (Recommended)**
```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute (if it exists)
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine qkflow-darwin-arm64 2>/dev/null || echo "No quarantine attribute (this is fine)"
chmod +x qkflow-darwin-arm64
```

> **Note**: If you see "No such xattr: com.apple.quarantine", that means the file wasn't quarantined and you can skip the xattr step.

**Solution 2: System Settings**
1. Try to run the binary (it will show the security warning)
2. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to find the blocked app
4. Click **Open Anyway**

**Solution 3: Temporary Gatekeeper Disable**
```bash
# Disable Gatekeeper temporarily (requires admin)
sudo spctl --master-disable

# Run your binary, then re-enable
sudo spctl --master-enable
```

#### "Permission Denied" Error

```bash
# Make sure the file is executable
chmod +x qkflow

# Check if /usr/local/bin is in your PATH
echo $PATH | grep -q "/usr/local/bin" && echo "✅ PATH is correct" || echo "❌ Add /usr/local/bin to PATH"

# Add to PATH if needed (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile)
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### General Issues

#### Command Not Found

```bash
# Check if qkflow is installed
which qkflow

# If not found, ensure it's in your PATH
ls -la /usr/local/bin/qkflow

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Update Issues

```bash
# Check current version
qkflow version

# Manual update (download latest binary and replace)
curl -L https://github.com/Wangggym/quick-workflow/releases/latest/download/qkflow-darwin-arm64 -o /tmp/qkflow-new
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /tmp/qkflow-new
chmod +x /tmp/qkflow-new
sudo mv /tmp/qkflow-new /usr/local/bin/qkflow
```
