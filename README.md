# quick-workflow

> The shell command based on jira-cli and github-cli for quick work

## Two quick commands for streamlined workflow:

1. `pr-create`: Automatically create a Git branch, submit a PR (Pull Request), capture PR details, link the PR to Jira, and update its status.
2. `pr-merge`: Automatically merge a PR, delete the Git branch, and update the Jira status in one swift command.

### Why use it

> Are you tired of the hassle of changing the status every time you create a PR, such as 'code review,' 'merged,' and dealing with repetitive tasks?

> Especially when you're busy and have opened multiple browser windows, waiting for pages to load just to complete these mundane tasks can be time-consuming, diverting our focus from more important matters.

Highlighted Benefits:

- Efficiency: Streamline the process by automating status updates and repetitive tasks.
- Time-Saving: Eliminate the need to open multiple browser tabs and wait for pages to load.
- Enhanced Focus: Allow users to concentrate on more crucial tasks.
- Reduced Manual Work: Minimize the need for manual status updates for each PR.
- Standardized Workflow: Ensures a consistent and error-free process.
