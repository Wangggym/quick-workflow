# quick-workflow

> Streamlined GitHub and Jira workflow automation tools

A modern CLI tool to automate your daily GitHub PR and Jira workflow, written in Go.

## 💡 Why use it

> Are you tired of the hassle of changing the status every time you create a PR, such as 'code review,' 'merged,' and dealing with repetitive tasks?

> Especially when you're busy and have opened multiple browser windows, waiting for pages to load just to complete these mundane tasks can be time-consuming, diverting our focus from more important matters.

**Highlighted Benefits:**

- **Efficiency**: Streamline the process by automating status updates and repetitive tasks.
- **Time-Saving**: Eliminate the need to open multiple browser tabs and wait for pages to load.
- **Enhanced Focus**: Allow users to concentrate on more crucial tasks.
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Minimize the need for manual status updates for each PR.
- **Standardized Workflow**: Ensures a consistent and error-free process.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated PR Creation**: Create branch, commit, push, and open PR in one command
- **Jira Integration**: Automatically link PRs to Jira tickets and update status
- **Smart Branch Management**: Auto-detect default branch (main/master)
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly prompts with support for cancellation (Ctrl+C)
- **One-Command Merge**: Merge PR, delete branch, and update Jira status
- **Browser Integration**: Auto-open PR in browser and copy URL to clipboard
- **Quick Update**: Commit and push with PR title as commit message (`qkflow update`)
- **iCloud Sync**: Automatic config sync across Mac devices (macOS only) ☁️

## ⚙️ Initial Setup

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
qkflow init
```

This will prompt you for:
- GitHub token (auto-detected from `gh` CLI if available)
- GitHub owner (username or organization)
- GitHub repository name
- Jira URL (e.g., https://your-company.atlassian.net)
- Jira email
- Jira API token ([Get one here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens))

**Configuration Storage:**

✨ **NEW**: On macOS, all configs are automatically saved to iCloud Drive and synced across your devices!

- **macOS with iCloud Drive**: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/.qkflow/` ☁️
- **Local Storage** (fallback): `~/.qkflow/`

Both locations contain:
- `config.yaml` - Main configuration
- `jira-status.json` - Jira status mappings

Run `qkflow config` to see your actual storage location.
