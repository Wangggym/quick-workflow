# Shell Version Installation

This directory contains the legacy shell script implementation of quick-workflow.

## Quick Install

From the project root:

```bash
cd shell-version
./install.sh
```

This will:
1. Make all scripts executable
2. Add aliases to your shell rc file (.zshrc or .bashrc)
3. Set up environment variables (you need to edit them with your actual values)

## Updating Existing Installation

If you previously installed from the root directory, your aliases are already updated to point to this directory. No action needed!

## Full Documentation

See [README.md](./README.md) for complete installation and usage instructions.
